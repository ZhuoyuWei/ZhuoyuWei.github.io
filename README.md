## Chemistry Exam Question Answering

In recently years, people are probably overwhelmed by news report about AI beat human beings for many times, and some of them are related to Question Answering (QA). For example, IBM Watson won Jeopardy by answering simple questions but with a broad range of knowledge; a lot of neural based models, e.g. XLNet and RoBERTa, beat human beings' performance on both Machine Reading Comprehension and Conversational QA; Ariso System from AI2 gets an 'Ace' for an eighth-grade science examination and is able to give 80 percent correct answers for 12th-grade science test.

Although AI have made such great achievements on the above QA tasks, it is still hard to tell machines have obtained intelligence as human beings. 
Machine intelligence is more appropriately viewed as a diverse collection of capabilities associated with intelligent behavior rather than a binary pass/fail on a specific task. Especially for a real-world QA task, the collection of capabilities should include a) natural language understanding; b) general inference, reasoning and computing; 3) general and domain-specific knowledge applying.

Question|At a particular temperature a 2.00 L flask at equilibrium contains $2.80 \times 10^{-4}$ mol $N_2$, $2.50 \times 10^{-5}$ mol $O_2$, and $2.00 \times 10^{-2}$ mol $N_2O$. How would you calculate K at this temperature for the following reaction: $N_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow N_2O(g)$ ?
 ------------| -------------
Variable to be solved|Equilibrium constant K of this reaction
Conditions provided| Volume of the flask is 2.00L.
------------| Mole of $N_2$ is  $2.80 \times 10^{-4}$ mol. 
------------| Mole of $O_2$ is  $2.50 \times 10^{-5}$ mol. 
------------| Mole of $N_2O$ is  $2.00 \times 10^{-2}$ mol.
------------|Reaction equation is  $N_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow N_2O(g)$. 
Knowledge required| K = $\frac{[N_2O]^a}{[N_2]^b[O_2]^c}$, $[*]$ is the molarity of *, and a,b,c are coefficients of matters.
------------| Molarity $=$ Mole / Volume.
------------| Balance the reaction equation following atomic conservation theory.
Solving steps |1. Balance the reaction equation to get a,b and c.
------------|2. Calculate molarities for $N_2$, $N_2$ and $O_2$ 
------------|3. Calculate K following K's formula 
Answer|$4.08 \times 10^8$.\\
